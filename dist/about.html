                                    Flexible Dieting(or commonly  known as 'If It Fits Your Macros') is simply the tracking of                                         macronutrients (protein, carbohydrate and fat) to achieve a body composition goal.
                                </p>
                                <br/>
                                <p>
                                    Macronutrients or Macros make up the majority of our diets. There are three main                                                   macronutrients: Protein, Fat and Carbohydrate.
                                </p>
                                <br/>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>1 gram of Protein = 4 Calories</li>
                                    <li>1 gram of Carbohydrate = 4 Calories</li>
                                    <li>1 gram of Fat = 9 Calories</li>
                                </ul>
                                <br/>
                                <p>
                                    Rather then typical calorie counting(eg. Eating 2000 calories a day), Flexible Dieters would                                       track macronutrient intake(eg. Eating 150g Protein, 170g Carbohydrate, 80g Fat = 2000                                               calories), which more effectively influences body composition rahter than just weight loss or                                       gain.
                                </p>
                                <br/>
                                <p>
                                    Flexible Dieting follows the belief that there are no miracle weight loss foods. No good or bad                                     foods, just macro ratios.
                                </p>
